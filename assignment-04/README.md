# Assignment 4

Before Oct. 22, please complete the following:

1. Complete the “Conditional Statements” section of the “[Learn Java from Scratch](https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-java-from-scratch)” course

   * **Please try to complete the coding challenges yourself before reviewing the solution!**

   * For those using VSCode, please use the skeleton files for the coding challenge.

     These are found in the shared folder (Assignment 4 subfolder)

   * As an extra challenge, modify [ConditionalsChallenge1.java](ConditionalsChallenge1.java) to see if you can take in user input at the command line (e.g., 41) and then print out if the input is “odd” or “even”

      Hint: Look at the [AdderShell.java](../assignment-02/AdderShell.java) from Assignment 2 for how to
take in a value from the command line

2. If you have not completed the GitHub exercise from Assignment 3, please do so this week.

3. If you have completed the GitHub exercise from Assignment 3, start practicing doing commits at logical places as you complete the challenges in the “Conditional Statements” sections
