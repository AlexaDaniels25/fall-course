    * This week's 3 coding challenges will all be pretty difficult
        * it will be important to practice coding iteratively
        * write some then test
        * use the debugger
        * ask mentors questions! erickeithlee@gmail.com ssmoser@gmail.com and cc vburns@fgrhs.org ldefeli1@ford.com
        
    * For those using VSCode, please use the 3 skeleton files for the coding challenge.
