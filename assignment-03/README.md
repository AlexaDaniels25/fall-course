# Assignment 3

Before Oct. 15, please complete the following:

1. Complete the “String and String Processing” section of the “Learn Java from Scratch”
course

   * **Please try to complete the coding challenge yourself before reviewing the solution!**

   * For those using VSCode, please use the skeleton file for the coding challenge.

     This is found in the shared (Assignment 3 subfolder)

2. Download and Install GitHub Desktop from https://desktop.github.com/

   * Read this Code Academy article on GitHub desktop https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-git-and-github-desktop

   * Create a GitHub repository on your laptop/desktop (**do NOT “publish” your repository online**).

      * The repository will look like a Windows folder

   * In VS Code, go to “File” -> “Open Folder” to open the new repository
   * Create a HelloWorld.java file with a println of “Hello World”

      * Save, compile, and run the code

   * Go to GitHub Desktop and do a “commit”

   * After the commit, go back to VS Code and change your HelloWorld.java by changing what is printed out (e.g., “Go Byting Irish!”)

      * Save, compile, and run the code

   * Go to GitHub Desktop and do a second “commit”

   * In GitHub Desktop “revert” the commit (go to “history” and right click and select “revert changes in commit”)

   * Go back to VS Code window and you should see your original HelloWorld.java
      * Compile and run the code (shouldn’t need to save)
