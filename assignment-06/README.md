By Nov. 5 please complete the following:

1. Complete "Loops" from the "[Learn Java from Scratch](https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-java-from-scratch)" course if you have not done so
    * **Please try to complete the 3 coding challenges yourself before reviewing the solution!**
    * The 3 coding challenges are all be pretty difficult
        * practice coding iteratively; write some then test
        * use the debugger
        * ask mentors questions! erickeithlee@gmail.com ssmoser@gmail.com and cc vburns@fgrhs.org ldefeli1@ford.com
    * For those using VSCode, please use the 3 skeleton files for the coding challenge.
        * These are found in the shared folder (Assignment 5 subfolder)
        * These are also available from the GitHub repository

2. Start "Methods" in the "[Learn Java from Scratch](https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-java-from-scratch)" course if you have not done so
    * **Please try to complete the first 2 coding challenges of Methods before Nov. 5**
    * For those using VSCode, please use the skeleton files for the coding challenge.
        * These are found in the shared folder (Assignment 6 subfolder) or GitHub repository
        * NOTE you will have to write your own method from scracth--the skeleton does not even include a stub for the method
        * NOTE the skeleton will not compile until you have created the method
