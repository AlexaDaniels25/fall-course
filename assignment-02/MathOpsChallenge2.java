/* The first step is done for you, which is the method. 
The method takes in two variables and computes a logical expression using them. 
For explanationâ€™s sake, the parameters are called x and y.

Now you must do the following:

    Find the Boolean NOT of x
    Boolean XOR the result of above with x itself
    Find the Boolean AND of the above answer with y
    Return the Boolean NOT of the entire expression
