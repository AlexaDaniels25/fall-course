# Assignment 2

Before Oct. 9, please complete the following:

1. If you have not installed WPILib/VSCode and created an Educative.io account (last week’s assignment), please do so as soon possible

2. Please confirm that you have access to the “[Software Team](https://fgrhsaaorg.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/RoboticsClub/Shared%20Documents/Software%20Team/Fall%2022%20Programming%20Course?csf=1&web=1&e=YvFFHR)” shared folder

3. Complete two sections of the “[Learn Java from Scratch](https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-java-from-scratch)” course

   * “Variables & User Input” section
   * “Simple Maths & Logic” section

4. For both sections, there are coding challenges.

   * Please try to code these yourselves before reviewing the solution!
   * Coding it yourself and making mistakes is the best way to learn.

5. For those using VSCode, we will be uploading to the “Software Team” shared folder a skeleton file for each of the coding challenges.

   These skeleton files will allow you to type in your solution in the same way that you would type it on the Educative.io website, but they allow you to compile and run your code using VSCode.
