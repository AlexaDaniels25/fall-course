# Assignment 1

Before Oct. 1, please complete the following:
1. Find a laptop running Windows that you can use this fall for this course.

   * If you do not have access to a laptop, you will be able to do most of the java programming through a web browser on almost any computer, including the computers in the FGR media center

2. Install WPILib, which includes the VS Code development environment, on your laptop

   * The latest release is WPILib [2022.4.1](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases/tag/v2022.4.1) (from Feb. 2022)
   * The installation instructions are available on the FRC website [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html).

      * You will want the "Everything" option
      * You will want the "Install for this User" option

3. Create a free [educative.io](https://educative.io) account and “register” for the “[Learn Java from Scratch](https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-java-from-scratch)” course.

   * Take 10 minutes to overview the full course. Note the estimated hours to complete the course.
   * As you will see, there are windows where you type in and run code. But ideally you would want to be writing your code in VSCode (it comes with the WPILib install) because that is what we use to program the robot in the winter.

4. Complete the “Getting Started with Java!” section of the “[Learn Java from Scratch](https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-java-from-scratch)” course

5. Show up at the FGR Media Center on Saturday, Oct. 1 at 1pm to 3pm for our first meeting.

   * The mentors will help ensure that you have VSCode installed if you have your own laptop.
   * If you are using a computer in the media center, we will ensure you can use the online coding windows provided by Educative.io.
   * Time permitting we will install Github Desktop.
